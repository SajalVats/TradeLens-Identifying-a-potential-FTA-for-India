## Team Members
- Aditya Partap Singh, MBA(IB) Class of '24
- Sajal Vats, MBA(IB) Class of '24

## Key Features
- **Product Selection**: Identification of products with high export potential and need for destination diversification.
- **RHI Analysis**: Measurement of concentration of India's export destinations at chapter level (2-digit HS codes).
- **RCA Analysis**: Assessment of India's export competitiveness and identification of products with declining RCA trends.
- **Country Selection**: Evaluation of countries for potential FTAs based on import demand and existing trade relations.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered trade data and calculated RHI and RCA values.
2. **Analysis**: Identified products with RHI > 0.5 and RCA > 1, focusing on those with declining RCA trends.
3. **Country Evaluation**: Analyzed potential FTA partners by studying their import demands and current trade agreements.

## Key Findings
- **Products Identified for Diversification**: Carpets and floor coverings (HS codes 570249 and 570500) with significant export potential to Iraq.
- **Potential FTA Benefits**: Increased market access for Indian exporters, reduction in trade concentration, and economic gains for both India and Iraq.

## Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis and strategic recommendations for India to leverage FTAs, particularly with Iraq, to enhance its export performance and economic growth.
